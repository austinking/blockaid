Developer Productivity - What's a Key Missing Metric?

I'm blocked!

* Amount of time developers are blocked

Reasons developers get blocked

* User error
* Broken builds / integration issues
* Infrastructure downtime

Real World Behavior

* Not enough people raise their hand in IRL or in #Engineering and say "I'm blocked"
* No flow of communication once a blocker has been fixed

Solution

[Gatorade Logo] BlockAid

* Create a culture around:
  * Asking for help
  * Helping others

MVP

A developer can see open blockers and report a new blocker situation

Developers can flag a blocker as affecting them as well

A Super Hero(or heros) can flag that they are helping fix the blocker

All parties can contribute notes to the blocker (Stack traces, links to issues, request more info, temporary workarounds, etc)

All parties are notified of updates

All parties can flag a blocker as fixed

All parties notified with the resolution and steps they need to do to fix their issue

Stretch Goals

* Provide common troubleshooting steps to unblock the reporter before they create a blocker
* Provide common workarounds as a step after create the blocker
* Triage blockers into root cause buckets

Possible Contributors

* Usual suspects (Design, Web Frontend, Backend/Data)
* HipChat, Twilio (SMS), Email plugins
